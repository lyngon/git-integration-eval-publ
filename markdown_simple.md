# Basic Markdown (GitHub compatible)

## Paragraph

By writing regular text you are basically writing a paragraph.

This is a paragraph.

## Headings

There are 6 heading variants. The number of "#" symbols, followed by text, indicates the importance of the heading.

# Heading 1

## Heading 2

### Heading 3

#### Heading 4

##### Heading 5

###### Heading 6

## Emphasis

Modifying text is so neat and easy. You can make your text bold, italic and strikethrough.

Using two asterisks **this text is bold**.  
Two underscores **work as well**.  
Let's make it _italic now_.  
You guessed it, _one underscore is also enough_.  
Can we combine **_both of that_?** Absolutely.  
What if I want to ~~strikethrough~~?

## Blockquote

Want to emphasise importance of the text? Say no more.

> This is a blockquote.
> Want to write on a new line with space between?
>
> > And nested? No problem at all.
> >
> > > PS. you can **style** your text _as you want_. :

## Images

The best way is to simply drag & drop image from your computer directly. You can also create reference to image and assign it that way.  
Here is the syntax.

![text if the image fails to load](image.png "Text displayed on hover")

[logo]: image.png "Hover me"

![error text][logo]

## Links

Similar to images, links can also be inserted directly or by creating a reference. You can create both inline and block links.

Find some great docs [here][docs]

Here's a link to [a public website](http://handshakes.ai), to a [local
doc](html-simple.html), and to a [section heading in the current
doc](#Paragraph).

## Code

You can cerate both inline and full block code snippets. You can also define programming language you were using in your snippet. All by using backticks.

I created `.env` file at the root.
Backticks inside backticks? `` `No problem.` ``

```
{
  learning: "Markdown",
  showing: "block code snippet"
}
```

```js
const x = "Block code snippet in JS";
console.log(x);
```

## Lists

As you can do in HTML, Markdown allows creating of both ordered and unordered lists.

### Ordered List

1. HTML
2. CSS
3. Javascript
4. React
5. I'm Frontend Dev now üë®üèº‚Äçüé®

### Unordered List

- Node.js

* Express

- Nest.js

* Learning Backend ‚åõÔ∏è

### Mixed List

You can also mix both of the lists and create sublists.  
**PS.** Try not to create lists deeper than two levels. It is the best practice.

1. Learn Basics
   1. HTML
   2. CSS
   3. Javascript
2. Learn One Framework
   - React
     - Router
     - Redux
   * Vue
   - Svelte

## Table

Great way to display well-arranged data. Use "|" symbol to separate columns and ":" symbol to align row content.

| Left Align (default) | Center Align | Right Align |
| :------------------- | :----------: | ----------: |
| React.js             |   Node.js    |       MySQL |
| Next.js              |   Express    |     MongoDB |
| Vue.js               |   Nest.js    |       Redis |

## Task List

Keeping track of the tasks that are done, and those that need to be done.

- [x] Learn Markdown
- [ ] Learn Frontend Development
- [ ] Learn Full Stack Development

## Footnote

Want to describe something at the end of the file? Use footnote!

#### I am working on a new project. [^1]

[^1]: Stack is: React, Typescript, Tailwind CSS

Project is about music & movies. [^2]

##### Hope you will like it. [^see]

[^see]: Loading... ‚åõÔ∏è

## Jump to section

You can jump straight to sections of the file from wherever you are.

[Jump back to the "Table" section](#Table)

## Horizontal Line

You can use asterisks, hyphens or underlines (\*, -, \_) to create horizontal line.  
The only rule is that you must include at least three chars of the symbol.

First Horizontal Line

---

Second One

---

Third

---

## HTML

You can also use raw HTML in your Markdown file. Most of the times that will work well, but sometimes you can experience some differences that you are not used to when working with standard HTML. Using CSS will not work.

<h1>This is HTML</h1>
<p>Paragraph...</p>

<hr />

<img src="image.png" width="200">

<br />
<br />

<p>Quick hack for <strong><em>centering image</em></strong>?</p>
<p align="center"><img src="image.png" width="200" /></p>
